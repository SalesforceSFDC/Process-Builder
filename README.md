# Salesforce Process Builder
Automated processes in the Process Builder consist of:
 * Criteria that determine when to execute action groups
 * Immediate and scheduled actions to execute when those criteria are met

Any change that causes a record to match the criteria automatically triggers the action group.

A schedule lets the process know that it must wait to execute the associated actions. Because you can configure multiple schedules for the same criteria node, each schedule has its own list of actions to execute.
